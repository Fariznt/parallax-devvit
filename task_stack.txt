do a proper fix of the hacked-together fix from last night for the import issue
deal with addressing conceptually and in arguments
    take parent address out of EvaluationState and keep as separate arg? rename evaluationstate accordingly, since 
    arguably its not all of the state?
write the evaluation recursion function  (dont forget to complete type definition)
get function annotations generated for the evaluateHelper function
do llm node definition
test yaml_parser
do rest of the node definitions
persistent storage of action information: full logging, modmails
make sure policy changing workflow makes sense (dont want to be using old policy, want maximum ease)
add function header comments

routing reports?

Future
1. support for posts, not just comments (image understanding? at least route title as a comment)
2. switch to yaml -> json conversion
3. check compatibility with other apis
4. consider migration to web-style when functional (high priority due to resume significance)
    allows UI for policy definition + UI action into reddit's interface for mods (ex. get trace) + webdev credibility
5. wrapping this is fundamental https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation?utm_source=chatgpt.com
6. incorporate use of post history

notes for me:
devvit settings set apiKey for setting apiKey
everything else set in mod tools
severity will be the closest upstream severity defined



policy traversal will be like this:

how about the traversal only produces a trace object with various info in it.
 one info is whether violation has occured (yet), other is what llm calls to queue. 
 if there are calls to queue, we use them and change the violation has occurred thing 
 if needed. once trace is done being generated, we extract the violation / no violation
  and return that along with the entire trace

figure out what im going to do in terms of tree representation. if decide against batch processing need to indicate in my architecture files
    these architectural decisions depend on the role this plays in the larger system
    perhaps: deterministic obvious removes (silent). removes + modmail. and non removes.
        i could keep the policyengine agnostic to this 3 way triage and do only 2 way. examine the trace, and llm involvement
        leads to modmail.
        So for r/izlam:
        final:
        all comments -> run through evaluation tree -> removed or not removed. if removed -> escalate to modmail with trace info
        report -> run through llm node -> remove or not removed. make removal sensitive/safe; if removed escalate to modmail else silent delete
        proto:
        all modqueue items -> run through llm -> trivial removed


        how can i deploy an automoderator 2nd phase version without writing much extra code that would be directly used in the final version?
            final version needs to be able to interact with modmail anyweayws and actually simply modmail event read + archive probably not too complicated, if feasible.
            i should rush early approval. then slowly work on building a proper engine that can be used elsewhere

theres a contention between having NOT and having deferred checks
    unless i can flip the semantic..... which is awkward
theres also awkwardness with deferred checks + not
    negate the interpretation of the deferred result
