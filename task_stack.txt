openai api key creation
get llm minimal example running through single eval
persistent storage of action information: full logging, modmails
migrate nodes classes


make sure policy changing workflow makes sense (dont want to be using old policy, want maximum ease)


add function header comments

Future
1. support for posts, not just comments (image understanding? at least route title as a comment)
2. switch to yaml -> json conversion

notes for me:
devvit settings set apiKey for setting apiKey
everything else set in mod tools
