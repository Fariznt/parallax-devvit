By accessing or using **Policy-Agent** (“the App”, “we”, “us”), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

### 2. Description of the Service
Policy-Agent is a software tool provided for experimental and moderation-assistance purposes. The Service may analyze user-generated content and produce automated outputs based on configurable rules or models. At present, the Service is operated solely by the project maintainer (u/PolicyAgent) for supervised use in select communities. Availability, access, or scope of use may change in the future, including potential availability to additional moderators or communities.

### 3. No Warranty
The Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available”**, without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable for your specific use case, and quality may vary by configuration.

### 4. User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for how you configure, deploy, and use the Service, including any actions taken based on your configuration (e.g., moderation decisions). Policy-Agent does not replace human judgment.

### 5. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Policy-Agent shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service.

### 6. Acceptable Use
You agree not to use the Service for unlawful purposes or in violation of any applicable platform policies, laws, or regulations. Your use, including but not limited to your app settings, policy definitions, and the resulting mod actions must abide by any applicable platform policies, laws, or regulations. 

### 7. Changes to the Terms
These Terms may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to the App. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date.
